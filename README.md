# Referer Validate 
The **RefererValidate** module and HTTP Provider for [Wowza Streaming Engine™ media server software](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine) allows you to control access to your application by checking referer domain.

## Prerequisites

## Usage
You apply an image tag to your client with a specified image path that points towards your Wowza server.  This allows Wowza to validate the requestor and then enables the stream for playback.
